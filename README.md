# techdegree-9-rest-api

In this project, I created a REST API using Express with that provides a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users will be required to log in so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account. I used Node.js, Express, REST APIS, and Sequelize to complete this project.

In the next project, I will use React to create a front-end client that uses this REST API as a part of a full-stack JavaScript application!

This was a challenging but exciting projected to work on. I really enjoyed working with Rest APIs and am really starting to enjoy backend development which is really surprising to me!
